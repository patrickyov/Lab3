The value shown as result of this operation in different programming languages is simply a matter of convention.

Simply put, it is the set of all integers that are equal to 2 plus an integer multiple of 5. This set would include (but is not limited to, as it is infinitely large) `{-18, -13, -8, -3, 2, 7, 12}`.
